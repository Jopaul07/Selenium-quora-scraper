I has a girl and she have a car,"The verb <b>have</b> does not seem to&nbsp;agree with the subject <b>she</b>. Consider changing the verb form.
A&nbsp;singular subject requires a&nbsp;singular verb, and a&nbsp;plural subject requires a&nbsp;plural verb. When there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;text between the subject and the verb, it’s easy to&nbsp;lose track of&nbsp;which words need to&nbsp;agree. When you need to&nbsp;determine what the subject&nbsp;is, it’s often helpful to&nbsp;ask who or&nbsp;what is&nbsp;“doing” the action of&nbsp;the verb. It’s possible for the word <i>there</i> to&nbsp;stand in&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;grammatical subject, as&nbsp;in&nbsp;sentences such as&nbsp;<i>There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;pie on&nbsp;the table</i> or&nbsp;<i>There are forks in&nbsp;the drawer.</i> In&nbsp;this type of&nbsp;construction, the verb is&nbsp;controlled not by&nbsp;the word <i>there</i> but by&nbsp;the logical subject of&nbsp;the clause, which usually comes right after the verb.
",I has a girl and she has a car
I has a girl and she has a car,"It&nbsp;appears that the subject pronoun <b>I</b> and the verb <b>has</b> are not in&nbsp;agreement. Consider changing the verb.
As&nbsp;the subject of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sentence or&nbsp;clause, a&nbsp;personal pronoun can be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the first person (<i>I, we</i>), the second person (<i>you</i>), or&nbsp;the third person <i>(he, she, it, they</i>). The same personal pronouns are either singular (<i>I, you, he, she, it</i>) or&nbsp;plural (<i>we, you, they</i>). Make sure that the form of&nbsp;the verb agrees with the form of&nbsp;the personal pronoun.

I like this colour,"The spelling of&nbsp;<b>colour</b> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-American variant. For consistency, consider replacing it&nbsp;with the American English spelling.
The spelling of&nbsp;some words varies among different dialects of&nbsp;English. For example, British English speakers write <i>colour</i>, while American English speakers write <i>color</i>.<br>
Typically, the spelling of&nbsp;these words only varies by&nbsp;one or&nbsp;two letters. In&nbsp;the interest of&nbsp;consistency and clarity, you should use the spelling that will be&nbsp;more familiar to&nbsp;your intended audience.
