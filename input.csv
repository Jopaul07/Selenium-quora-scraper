"Everybody behaves well with you in an air conditioned restaurant. Everybody behaves well with you at their or your home. Because we are comfortable then. Real nature comes up when you miss your bus to the destination, the hotel you booked tells they cannot provide you the room, or the person loses his/her wallet , or you have only one packet of chips left with you and many more."
